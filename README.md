# orb
`orb` is an extendable bash cli companion for developers. It functions as a wrapper for bash commands and provides explicit argument declaration, collection, validation and autogenerated function lists and help texts.

The `orb` core comes with some built in commands and utils, mostly related to docker container management, see core namespaces section.

## How it works

All you have to do is put your functions inside an orb extension file and declare your functions arguments eg like below:

```BASH
touch my_project_root/_orb_extensions/my_namespace.sh
chmod +x my_project_root/_orb_extensions/my_namespace.sh

# my_project_root/_orb_extensions/my_namespace.sh
declare -A my_function_args=(
  ['1']='first inline argument'
  ['2']='second inline argument'
  ['-b']='boolean flag'
  ['-f arg']='flag followed by argument'
  ['*']='rest of arguments'
); function my_function() { # This is my function comment
  echo "$1 $2"
  ${_args[-b]} && echo "got -b"
  echo "${_args[-f arg]}"
  echo "rest of args: ${_args_wildcard[@]}"
}

# Than call your extended function from anywhere inside your project

$ orb my_namespace my_function -b -f "arg_f" "arg_1" "arg_2" some more args
# =>
#  arg_1 arg_2
#  got -b
#  arg_f
#  rest of args: some more args

orb my_namespace --help
# =>
#  -----------------     local _orb_extensions
#  MY_NAMESPACE.SH
#    my_function         This is my function comment

orb my_namespace my_function --help
# =>
#  my_function - This is my function comment
#
#    ARG     DESCRIPTION                DEFAULT  IN  REQUIRED  OTHER
#    1       first inline argument      -        -   true      -
#    2       second inline argument     -        -   true      -
#    -b      boolean flag               -        -   -         -
#    -f arg  flag followed by argument  -        -   -         -
#    *       rest of arguments          -        -   true      -
```

## List of argument options
```BASH
 declare -A my_function_args=(
		['1']='short description of first non-match flag arg; IN: value1|value2; DEFAULT: $checkedvar|value1'
		['2']='second non-match flag arg; OPTIONAL'
		['-r']='r flag description; DEFAULT: true'
 	['-e arg']='-e flag followed by value arg; REQUIRED'
		['*']='matches rest of args when non req inline arg fail IN requirement or not sought'
 ); function my_function() {}

 Boolean flags should be single char to allow multiple flag statements such as -ri

 +r sets [-r]=false. Useful if [-r]=DEFAULT: true - Inspired by bash options https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/options.html

 Note the available argument properties
 - Numbered args are required unless prop OPTIONAL or supplied DEFAULT
 - Flag args are optional unless prop REQUIRED
 - IN lists multiple accepted values with |
 - DEFAULT can eval variables and falls back through | chain when undef.
 - ['*'] or ['1'] (any nr) with ACCEPTS_FLAGS allows unrecognized flag to start assignment


 Values are then stored in $_args array
 and can be retrieved by eg:

 ${_args["-e arg"]} => arg_value if applied
 ${_args[-e]} => true if applied
 ${_args['*']} => true if wildcards exist
 ${_args_wildcard[@]} holds wildcard args as nested arrays not supported

 Numbered args and wildcards also passed as inline args to function call.
 This allows expected access through: $1, $2, $@/$* etc


 If the first argument of any function is --help
 An argument help output will be printed
```

## Installation
```BASH
  cd my_dir
  git clone https://github.com/sharetransition/orb-cli.git
  # Extend path in ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc and resource/restart shell
  PATH=$PATH:my_dir/orb-cli

  # Now you can use the orb command
  orb --help
```

It comes with a some built in commands primarily for docker container management.

## Core namespaces and commands
See `orb --help` for more information about core namespaces and functions. As with the creation of a new namespace shown above, you can also hook into and extend/override core namespaces in the same way. Any functions/commands prefixed with `_` are already sourced/required by the core and so they can be called directly without `orb` prefix (if so however without argument collection/validation)

### Docker namespace

docker commands expect project root to contain the following files
- `docker-compose.yml`  - shared base file
- `docker-compose.dev.yml`
- `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- `docker-compose.staging.yml`
- `docker-compose.idle.yml` - useful for debugging when usual startup command fails
- `.env` - with some vars listed below
- `_docker/Dockerfile` -  for rebuilding main image

#### For example:

- `orb start dev` will start your docker-compose project with base file + dev. Also provides $CURRENT_ENV/$CURRENT_ID/$CURRENT_GID that can used in your compose files.
- `orb start dev -i` will start your docker-compose project with base file + dev + idle
- `orb bash prod -s db` will enter the db service container in your production compose project with bash/sh
- `orb bash dev -s web pwd` will run pwd command inside container

`my_project_root/.env`
```
# Container name prefix
APP_NAME=my_app
DEFAULT_SERVICE=web

# If image exists locally or on docker hub, it will be used instead of Dockerfile
# To force build from Dockerfile, use orb docker rebuild
BUILD_IMAGE=dockerhub_user/image
PARENT_IMAGE=ruby:2.7.2-alpine
```
